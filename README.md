  2. Frequency ----> X-axis controls the frequency (distance between wave peaks).
                \--> Y-axis controls a second parameter that introduces phase into the wave.
  
  3. Magnitude/Speed ----> X-axis controls the magnitude of the wave
                \--> Y-axis controls the speed of the animation
  
  4. More Phase ---> X-axis controls if it is on or off. halfway is the trigger.
